# who is on call?

Do you:
 
a) Use pager duty
b) Have to be on call 
c) Sometimes wonder if it's you, and are too lazy to open your calendar?

Wow, remarkably you have come to the right place!

Install this thing (you need golang):

```sh
go install github.com/draxil/whoisoncall@latest
```

Now do:

```sh
whoisoncall the ics URL
```

As a fellow lazy person you probably want to wrap this up as a shell script so you don't need that URL every time!
